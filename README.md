# Data Science portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

## Instructions for running Python notebooks locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a Jupyter notebook server.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
