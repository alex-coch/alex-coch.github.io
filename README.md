# Data Science portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

## Instructions for running Python notebooks locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a Jupyter notebook server.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
 ``` 
 Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, AWS, Heroku. 
 ```
 - [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
 - [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
 - [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
 - [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](/smartcab/smartcab.ipynb): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
